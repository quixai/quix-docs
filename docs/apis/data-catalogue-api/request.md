# Forming a request

How you send requests to the Data Catalogue API will vary depending on
the client or language you’re using. But the API still has behavior and
expectations that is common across all clients.

!!! tip

	The examples in this section show how to use the popular [`curl`](https://curl.se/){target=_blank} command line tool.

## Before you begin

  - Sign up on the Quix Portal

  - Read about [Authenticating with the Data Catalogue
    API](authenticate.md)

## Endpoint URLs

The Data Catalogue API is available on a per-workspace basis, so the
subdomain is based on a combination of your organization and workspace
names. See [How to get a workspace
ID](../../platform/how-to/get-workspace-id.md) to find out how to get the
exact hostname required. It will be in this format:

    https://telemetry-query-${organization}-${workspace}.platform.quix.ai/

So your final endpoint URL will look something like:

    https://telemetry-query-acme-weather.platform.quix.ai/

## Method

Most endpoints use the `POST` method, even those that just fetch data.
Ensure your HTTP client sends `POST` requests as appropriate.

Using `curl`, the `-X POST` flag specifies a POST request. Note that
this is optional if you’re using the `-d` flag to send a payload (see
below).

``` bash
curl -X POST ...
```

## Payload

For most methods, you’ll need to send a JSON object containing supported
parameters. You’ll also need to set the appropriate content type for the
payload you’re sending:

``` bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" ...
```

!!! warning

	You **must** specify the content type of your payload. Failing to include this header will result in a `415 UNSUPPORTED MEDIA TYPE`	status code.

You can send data via a POST request using the `curl` flag `-d`. This
should be followed by either a string of JSON data, or a string starting
with the *@* symbol, followed by a filename containing the JSON data.

``` bash
curl -d '{"key": "value"}' ...
curl -d "@data.json" ...
```

## Complete curl example

You should structure most of your requests to the API around this
pattern:

``` bash
curl -H "Authorization: ${token}" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "@data.json" \
     https://${domain}.platform.quix.ai/${endpoint}
```
